# **Datasets**

Documentation for the datasets used in **COmpressive Seismic Acquisition Design (COSAD)** project:

* `cube4.npy`
* `data.npy`
* `spii15s.npy`
* `syn3D_cross-spread2.npy`

# **`cube4.npy`**
Data from the Stratton 3D Survey, a small land 3D data set from South Texas located in Stratton Field, a fluvially deposited gas. The complete 3D source/receiver geometry consists of east-west receivers lines spaced 402 m apart (12 arrays in total) and north-south source lines spaced 268 m apart. For further information refer to https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/Stratton_3D_survey.

**Seismic adquisition parameters:**

* Time samples (`nt`) = `1001`
* Number of traces (`nx`) = `80`
* Number of shots (`ns`) = `18`
* Time interval (`dt`) = `0.003` ms
* Trace interval (`dx`) = `25` m

# **`data.npy`**
Synthetic dataset composed of 40 shots with 970 ms in-depth and 3.15 km of horizontal length. For seismic traces reconstruction, it was selected shot #20 and cropped to 800 and 100 samples in time and traces, respectively. For further information refer to https://github.com/PyLops/curvelops/blob/main/examples/Demo_Seismic_Regularization.ipynb.

**Seismic adquisition parameters:**

* Time samples (`nt`) = `800`
* Number of traces (`nx`) = `100`
* Number of shots (`ns`) = `1`
* Time interval (`dt`) = `0.568` ms
* Trace interval (`dx`) = `5` m

# **`spii15s.npy`**
This data was built by the SEG Advanced Modeling Program (SEAM) during its second project, called "SEAM Phase IIâ€“Land Seismic Challenges". The Foothills models are focused on mountainous regions with sharp topography at the surface and compressive fold and thrust tectonics at depth.

**Seismic adquisition parameters:**

* Time samples (`nt`) = `1034`
* Number of traces (`nx`) = `100`
* Number of shots (`ns`) = `15`
* Time interval (`dt`) = `0.004` ms
* Trace interval (`dx`) = `12.5` m

# **`syn3D_cross-spread2.npy`**
Synthetic cross-spread seismic data modeled using finite differences with `devito`package (for further information refer to https://github.com/devitocodes/devito). The simulated geological conditions were semi-horizontal layers with minor folds and velocity anomalies. The total length of the seismic design is 1010 m horizontally and 1000 ms in depth.

**Seismic adquisition parameters:**

* Time samples (`nt`) = `1106`
* Number of traces (`nx`) = `101`
* Number of shots (`ns`) = `15`
* Time interval (`dt`) = `0.000905` ms
* Trace interval (`dx`) = `10` m
